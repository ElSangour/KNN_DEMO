# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using the scikit-learn library. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using a confusion matrix.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure that the following libraries are installed:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing phase includes:

- Loading the dataset and splitting it into features (`X`) and labels (`y`).
- Splitting the data into training and test sets.
- Scaling the features to standardize the range of the independent variables and improve the performance of the KNN algorithm.

### 2. Model Training

Once the data is preprocessed, the KNN classifier is initialized. We specify the number of neighbors (in this case, 5), and the model is trained using the training dataset (`X_train`, `y_train`).

### 3. Model Evaluation

After the model is trained, we make predictions on the test set (`X_test`). The predictions are compared with the actual labels (`y_test`) to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. We use metrics like the confusion matrix and accuracy score.

### 4. Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix gives a detailed breakdown of the classification performance. It shows the number of:

- True Positives (correctly classified positive cases)
- True Negatives (correctly classified negative cases)
- False Positives (incorrectly classified positive cases)
- False Negatives (incorrectly classified negative cases)

Example confusion matrix output:

```


                 precision    recall  f1-score   support

    Iris-setosa       1.00      1.00      1.00         9
Iris-versicolor       0.93      1.00      0.96        13
 Iris-virginica       1.00      0.88      0.93         8

       accuracy                           0.97        30
      macro avg       0.98      0.96      0.97        30
   weighted avg       0.97      0.97      0.97        30

[[ 9  0  0]
 [ 0 13  0]
 [ 0  1  7]]


```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective way of implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using scikit-learn. The steps include:

1. Preprocessing the data.
2. Training the KNN model.
3. Evaluating the model using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

This basic approach can be extended and customized based on different datasets and parameter tuning.
